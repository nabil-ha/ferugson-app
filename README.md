Freguson is a comprehensive platform designed to enhance the management and performance of sports teams through advanced technology. It caters to two primary user roles: Coaches and Players, offering tailored functionalities for each.​
This project was ✨ Vibe Coded ✨.
Core Features:

1. Authentication & User Management: Facilitates user registration and login with role-based access control, ensuring secure and personalized experiences for Coaches and Players.​

2. Coach Dashboard: Provides Coaches with tools to view team rosters, monitor individual player performance metrics, track training sessions, generate AI-driven insights, and manage player injuries and fatigue.​

3. Player Dashboard: Enables Players to access their performance metrics, track training sessions, monitor fatigue levels, view AI-generated insights, and report personal fatigue, fostering self-awareness and proactive health management.​

4. AI Integration: Incorporates AI capabilities for injury risk prediction, fatigue level assessment, and performance analysis, delivering actionable insights to both Coaches and Players.​

5. Performance Tracking: Monitors key performance indicators such as speed, stamina, accuracy, and tactical ratings, with data visualization through radar charts and trend analysis over time.​

6. Session Management: Allows for the creation and management of training sessions, tracking of player attendance, session confirmations, and focus area definitions to optimize training outcomes.

## AI Models

The app uses custom-trained AI models for injury risk prediction and fatigue assessment:

- **Fatigue Prediction Model**: [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T7PRnqKypQA2D1axY5GHappG0SVoPIUk?usp=sharing)
- **Injury Risk Prediction Model**: [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZK9g-afMaM8ryim5TeSr3c1MIWi49sT1?usp=sharing)

These models provide the underlying intelligence for the AI insights and risk assessments shown in the app.
